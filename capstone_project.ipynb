    "Istanbul is one of the biggest cities in the world with a population over 15 million. It is also a big entartainment center for both tourists and residents. Until a few years ago, Beyoğlu was the number one borough for all kinds of entartainment venues, but it started to change after a few terrorist attacks and bad political decisions. After that Kadıköy borough which is located in the Asia side of the city increased its popularity. On the other hand, city authorities tries to attract people to Beyoğlu, and increase its popularity again.\n",

    "In this project I will compare two boroughs of Istanbul which are centeral places for entertainment venues. Specifically I will interested in music venues. \n",

    "This will help investors that interested in opening a music venue in the city. It will be helpful if we can provide information about density, location, and type information of music venues to them."
